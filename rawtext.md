Big news from [Mira Murati](https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027?s=46&t=6FDPaNxZcbSsELal6Sv7Ug) and [FB Reality Labs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41650047) today, but the actual technical news you can use today is Llama 3.2:

As teased by Zuck and previewed in the Llama 3 paper ([our coverage here](https://buttondown.com/ainews/archive/ainews-llama-31-the-synthetic-data-model/)), the Multimodal versions of Llama 3.2 released as anticipated, adding a 3B and a 20B vision adapter on a frozen Llama 3.1:

The 11B is comparable/slightly better than Claude Haiku, and the 90B is comparable/slightly better than GPT-4o-mini, though you will have to dig a lot harder to find out [how far it trails behind 4o, 3.5 Sonnet, 1.5 Pro, and Qwen2-VL](https://mmmu-benchmark.github.io/#leaderboard) with a 60.3 on MMMU.

Meta is being praised for their open source here, but don't miss [the multimodal Molmo 72B and 7B models from AI2](https://x.com/allen_ai/status/1838956313902219595) also releasing today. It has not escaped [/r/localLlama's attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1fpb4m3/molmo_models_outperform_llama_32_in_most_vision/) that Molmo is outperforming 3.2 in vision:

The release notes hint at some very tight on device collaborations with Qualcomm, Mediatek, and Arm:

> The weights being released today are based on BFloat16 numerics. Our teams are actively exploring quantized variants that will run even faster, and we hope to share more on that soon.

> **Swyx commentary**: Whoa, 74 lessons in 2 hours. I've worked on this kind of very tightly edited course content before and it's amazing that this is free! Chapters 1-2 cover some necessary RAG table stakes, but then it was delightful to see Chapter 3 teach important ETL and IR concepts, and learn some new things on cross encoding, rank fusion, and query translation in 4 and 5. We shall have to cover this on livestream soon!
